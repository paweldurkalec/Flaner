# Flaner — Flat Planner (Docs)

Overview

Flaner (Flat planner) is a lightweight desktop application for quickly annotating a flat (apartment) sketch or photo, setting a measured scale, and displaying an overlaid grid at configurable granularity.

Goals (first iteration)

- Allow user to open an image (sketch or photo) of a flat plan.
- Let user define a scale by clicking two points on the image and entering the real-world distance.
- Draw an overlay grid matched to the scale, with configurable spacing (granularity).
- Keep a very small and dependency-light codebase using Python 3.13 and pygame.

Files in this doc set

- `docs/design.md`: design rationale and math behind grid/scale computation.
- `docs/usage.md`: quick user guide for the first iteration.
